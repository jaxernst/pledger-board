# Pledger Board
https://pledger-board.vercel.app/

A fully onchain game built to make high achievement fun.

Pledger Board is built around the core principle of making positive commitments in public spaces. 
The game allows users to make commitments to themselves, follow through with their commitments, and earn 
reputation for their high achiement.



The goal of the game is to earn Reputation, an in game metric for evaluating achievement. Reputation is earned from other users rating your commitments
and attesting to you completing your commitments.

# How the game works
* Commitment creation: Users describe their commitments and set a deadline for the commitment.
* Commitment rating: Commitments then appear in a public 'review' board, where anyone can rate the commitment according
 to specific criteria (how ambitious the commitment is, how positive the outcome would be, and how easy it is to prove completion)
* Commitment completion: Commitment creators must submit artifacts (usually photos/screenshots/pdfs) to prove they have completed there commitment BEFORE the deadline.
* Commitment attestation: Any user who rated a commitment during the rating phase gains the ability to attest to the 'proof' artifacts. Each time a commitment proof is 
* attested to, the creator earns reputation. Higher rated commitments earn more reputation.
